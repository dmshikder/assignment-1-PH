        <p>
          To stay focused means to simply persist with the task at hand. To
          continue to work towards whatever it is that I need to do and ensure
          that I stay concentrated on that one activity. It isn't multitasking.
          It isn't daydreaming. It's focusing in on the task at hand and putting
          in the work to get it done.
